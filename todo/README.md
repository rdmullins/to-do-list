*TO-DO LIST* is a single-page web application that utilizes local storage for a lightweight and reliable way to keep track of tasks.

### Installation
*TO-DO LIST* is entirely web-hosted and runs in the browser of your choice. No installation required!

### Usage
- Add a New Task
    - Just click in the text box at the top of the page, enter a description of the task, and click the 'Add Item' button.
- Change View
    - Use the radio buttons at the bottom of the page to switch between the three views:
        - Pending
        - Completed
        - All
- Edit an Existing Item (Active/Pending items only)
    - Double-click on the item row and enter the new text. (This adds an 'updated' time stamp to the item).
- Mark an Item Completed
    - Click the checkbox to the left of the item. This adds an updated time stamp and moves the item to the Completed list.
- Remove a Single Item (Pending or Completed)
    - Click the red 'X' to the right side of the item. This removes the item (i.e. it will no longer be visible).
- Remove All Completed Items
